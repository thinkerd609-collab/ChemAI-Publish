1.1 The Global Microplastic Crisis  
The anthropogenic proliferation of plastic polymers has transitioned from a structural convenience of the 20th century to a defining geological marker of the Anthropocene. As of 2025, global annual plastic production exceeds 460 million metric tons, with a significant fraction entering terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as mismanaged waste (Zhu et al., 2025). Photo-oxidation, mechanical abrasion, and microbial action degrade macroplastics into microplastics (MPs, <5 mm) and nanoplastics (NPs, <1 μm) that are now ubiquitous. Recent assessments highlight severe risks to biodiversity, including endocrine disruption in marine biota and trophic transfer into human food chains, while MPs serve as vectors for persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals (Zhu et al., 2025). Atmospheric transport has carried these particles to remote alpine regions and polar ice caps, underscoring the urgent need for standardized, high-throughput analytical frameworks.

1.2 Regional Challenges in South Asia and Pakistan  
The crisis is particularly acute in the Global South, where rapid industrialization frequently outpaces regulatory capacity. In South Asia, the Indus River system acts as both lifeline and major conduit for plastic debris to the Arabian Sea. Textile wastewater from spinning and dyeing units in Pakistan constitutes a primary point source of micro-fiber pollution, discharging untreated effluents directly into freshwater bodies (Khanam et al., 2025). Urban reservoirs such as Rawal Lake have become significant sinks for high-density polyethylene and polystyrene fragments, exacerbated by inadequate municipal filtration. Longitudinal data remain scarce and standardized protocols for weathered polymers in turbid matrices are absent, making cost-effective, localized monitoring not merely desirable but essential for regional environmental security.

1.3 The Analytical Bottleneck in Microplastic Monitoring  
Effective mitigation is hindered by a persistent “analytical bottleneck.” Sample collection now vastly outpaces laboratory characterization. A single environmental sample from riverine sediment or wastewater may contain thousands of potential microplastic candidates, yet manual sorting and visual identification yield false-positive rates exceeding 60% and fail entirely for particles below 100 μm (Cabot et al., 2024). Spectroscopic verification remains the rate-limiting step, and hyperspectral imaging generates data volumes unmanageable by traditional manual workflows, particularly when pushing detection limits toward the sub-10 μm range.

1.4 Strengths and Limitations of Conventional Raman and FTIR Spectroscopy  
Vibrational spectroscopy remains the gold standard for non-destructive polymer identification. Micro-FTIR (especially focal-plane-array mode) enables rapid filter scanning and provides strong signals for oxygenated polymers, yet is limited by the infrared diffraction limit (typically 10–20 μm) and water-vapor interference in environmental samples (Sunil et al., 2025). Raman spectroscopy offers superior spatial resolution down to 1 μm and performs well in aqueous matrices, but suffers from biological fluorescence and longer acquisition times for mapping (Sunil et al., 2025). Both techniques struggle with weathered environmental plastics whose spectra deviate from pristine library references due to oxidation and biofouling, resulting in frequent misclassification by conventional library-matching algorithms.

1.5 Emergence of Machine Learning as a Transformative Solution (2024–2026)  
Machine learning has emerged as the decisive solution to these limitations. Between 2024 and 2026 the field advanced from simple classifiers to deep-learning architectures that extract subtle features from noisy spectra. Similarity-learning frameworks now identify weathered polymers by chemical relationships rather than exact matches (Smolen et al., 2025). Convolutional neural networks automate hyperspectral-cube processing, simultaneously capturing morphology and composition (Zhang et al., 2025). Ensemble models on TGA-FTIR data enable bulk polymer quantification without individual particle counting (Müller et al., 2025). Explainable AI and vision transformers further reveal the vibrational bands driving decisions, enhancing regulatory trust (Sunil et al., 2025). These advances are rapidly converting raw spectral data into actionable environmental intelligence.

1.6 Objectives and Novelty of This Review  
This review presents the first comprehensive 2026 critical synthesis of ML-enhanced Raman and FTIR spectroscopy for microplastic detection and quantification. It benchmarks architectures ranging from random forests to transformers against real-world environmental datasets (Li et al., 2026), evaluates Raman–FTIR data fusion (Zhang et al., 2025), and introduces a practical “South Asia Roadmap” for low-cost, portable Raman-ML systems in resource-limited settings such as Pakistan (Li et al., 2026). By focusing on field-deployable edge-AI tools, the review directly supports UN Sustainable Development Goals 6 and 14.  

This critical assessment of the digital-analytical interface serves as a necessary precursor to understanding the underlying spectroscopic principles that define the field.
