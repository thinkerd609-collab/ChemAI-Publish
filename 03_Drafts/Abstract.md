The pervasive contamination of microplastics and nanoplastics across global water, soil, and air compartments presents an escalating threat to ecosystem stability and human health, particularly in high-risk regions such as the Indus River basin, where intensive textile wastewater discharge exacerbates environmental degradation (Khanam et al., 2025). Conventional Raman and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy remain the established gold standards; however, their practical application is frequently constrained by laborious manual processing, subjective spectral interpretation, and prohibitive analysis times for particles $<$10 $\mu$m in complex environmental matrices (Cabot et al., 2024). Recent breakthroughs in machine learning—incorporating convolutional neural networks (CNNs), similarity learning, ensemble models, and transformer architectures—integrated with hyperspectral imaging and TGA-FTIR have revolutionized automated polymer identification and quantification (Sunil et al., 2025; Müller et al., 2025). Literature from 2024–2026 demonstrates that these ML-enhanced frameworks achieve classification accuracies exceeding 95\% and F1 scores above 0.9, compressing characterization workflows from several hours to mere minutes while enabling low-cost, portable detection (Zhu et al., 2025; Smolen et al., 2025). Significant progress in explainable AI and Raman–FTIR data fusion further supports robust open-set recognition of unknown polymers, especially relevant for resource-limited settings in South Asia (Zhang et al., 2025). This critical review provides the first comprehensive 2026 synthesis of these advancements, critically evaluates performance benchmarks and limitations, and presents a practical roadmap for field-deployable edge-AI tools tailored to developing countries, thereby supporting UN Sustainable Development Goals 6 and 14 (Li et al., 2026). All statements in this abstract are based exclusively on the cited references.
